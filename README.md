💳 Online Payment Gateway – Java Console Application

This is a simple **Java-based console application** that simulates an online payment gateway. It collects card details, validates them, and processes a payment based on predefined rules.
🛠️ Features

- Accepts payment details from the user:
  - Card Number (16 digits)
  - CVV (3 digits)
  - Expiry Date (MM/YY)
  - Payment Amount
- Validates payment details format
- Processes payments up to ₹10,000
- Displays success or failure messages

🧾 Validation Rules

- Card Number must be **16 digits**
- CVV must be **3 digits**
- Expiry Date must be in **MM/YY** format
- Amount must be **greater than ₹100**
- Payments above ₹10,000 are **rejected**

📦 How It Works

The program uses two main classes:

- `PaymentDetails`: Stores and validates the user’s payment information.
- `PaymentProcessor`: Processes the payment if all validations pass.
